# zoe ![Build](https://github.com/NudelErde/zoe/workflows/Build%20(with%20CMake)/badge.svg) [![FOSSA Status](https://app.fossa.com/api/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2FNudelErde%2Fzoe.svg?type=shield)](https://app.fossa.com/projects/git%2Bgithub.com%2FNudelErde%2Fzoe?ref=badge_shield)
*zoe* is a video game engine that I am working on in my free time. It probably won't surpass *Unity3D* or *Unreal Engine* but where is the fun in using any of these if you can make your own!

I want it to be as optimized as possible but am limited to my free time.


## Running
zoe is still work in progress. You can try running [the sandbox](https://github.com/NudelErde/zoe/releases) but please don't expect anything other than a simple demo.

# Compiling
I don't know why you would like to compile zoe at its current state, but...

You can compile zoe [as we tell CircleCI to](https://github.com/NudelErde/zoe/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml).
* Make sure you are using a Linux machine to compile and run zoe
* Install all dependencies `apt install build-essential cmake libglew-dev libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev libgl-dev`

1. Clone the repository with `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/NudelErde/zoe.git` (Or use `git submodule update --init --recursive` when you already cloned)
2. Run `cmake .` and let *cmake* prepare everything
3. Run `cmake --build .` to build zoe

Your artifacts are located in `./sandbox/sandbox` and `./zoe/libzoe.so`
